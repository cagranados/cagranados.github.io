    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Motivated by the presence of financial spillovers from advanced economies on emerging markets, and the apparent difficulties of the latter to shield their economies from external shocks, I set up a three-country center-periphery model (with two emerging economies and one advanced economy) with banks and financial agency frictions à la Gertler and Karadi (2011). The key defining feature of an emerging economy will be the limited capacity of financial intermediation that leads to a financial dependency relation with the center. Each country will have access to a macroprudential instrument that affects directly its source of inefficiencies and allows to smooth the credit spread distortions. However, such regulation can be costly and interdependent, opening a potential scope for
coordination or strategic interactions. The addition of a second emerging country is relevant to enhance the interaction leverage of the peripheric block, as well
as to allow for strategic interactions between emerging countries at the regional level. Within this framework, I aim to evaluate the optimal macroprudential
instrument and welfare features of a variety of policy arrangements that differ by their degree of cooperation. In particular, I look for gains of coordination, but also
for their distribution across economies. Finally, the framework allows to carry experiments with some of the peripheric features and explore whether global or
regional incentives for coordination change meaningfully with the addition of new economies to a peripheric economic block. </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> In order to understand the strategic interactions between financial regulators in open emerging economies we set a multicountry general equilibrium model with multiple peripheries, a long-lived banking sector and dynamic macro-prudential policies. This framework allows us to perform a welfare accounting exercise that accounts for the totality of policy effects over time and to rank a variety of policy frameworks that differ by their degree of international policy coordination. We obtain that not every type of policy coordination would generate welfare gains with respect to inward looking policies. Instead, only schemes where the financial center of reference is cooperative will generate gains, impliying that emerging countries coalitions can be counterproductive. Furthermore, we show that in relation to lower ranked models, the best performing policy frameworks implement a countercyclical macroprudential policy, while at the same time the policies can comove with the cycle in some scenarios, a result that helps reconcile literature debates on the cyclicality of optimal macroprudential tools. Finally, we study the dynamic path of the optimal financial instruments and describe the features characterizing cooperative policy settings. </p></div>
