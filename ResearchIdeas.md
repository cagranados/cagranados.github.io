## [New] Comparison between Macroprudential Policies and Capital Controls 
How do macroprudential regulation compares with capital controls? which one is more impactful, effective, and less costly/enforceable?. Intuition would dictate it depends on the source of frictions to mitigate, but also that regulating the banking sector where the frictions originate may be more convenient than regulating the households. 

**Starting point:** Taxes on Balance Sheet components of banks VS. Taxes on Capital Flows

### Background: 
1. I find regulation effects of bankign taxes are sizable due to profits retention which implies the effect of the instruments are long lasting in the net worth of the banks. That allows me to obtain sizable welfare differences between different cooperative regimes.
2. Ippei's work on equivalence of sterilized interventions and capital controls
(Potential nuances: does either have relevant ER implications?)

## [1] Empirical Evidence of Strategic Financial Regulations 

Can be proven that in addition to responding to fundamentals, the macroprudential policies are also reacting directly to the regulations of other economies?
Strategy: Policy Action_i as function of policy_action_AEs + controls **+ Compliance to Basel III**
(refine)  compliance can be a proxy of cooperating. Then interaction of compliance with crossed policy actions coef could indicate how much strategic behaviour is mitigated by cooperation. It can also be a control, then it indicates (in eq. above) how policy actions react to other players' even after accounting for fundamentals and for regulatory mandates.

## [2] Sustainability of Cooperative Policy Regimes 

Incentives to deviate from coordinated regimes, repeated interaction under commitment.
Emerging Cooperation is hurtful. But, could it be used to coerce a Center into cooperating in the future?

## [3] limiting regulatory arbitrage with regulation: 

Studies on effectiveness of MaP indicate that the effect of the tools may change greatly depending on the scope at which they are applied. For example, 
LTV limits applied only on household deposits may lead to a switch towards non-bank (shadow) financial intermediaries or foreign banks by borrowers (IMF, iMaPP paper 2019 and presentation). It may be also the case that such arbitrage could be limited if, simultaneously, other policies are active, such as strict capital requirements on other banking activities. Then it could be that the MaPP should be applied in tandem, rather than independently. It can be interesting to check to what extent: 

1) MaPP tools can be sustitute or complementary measures (does one make the other redundant, or it makes sense to apply them both to have the intended effect and limit 
arbitrage?).
2) it is more efficient, in terms of the cost of policy (implementation for example) to attack a given friction with more than one instrument. 
3) verifying if statements on complementarity, subsitutability and conveniency of extensive application (in tandem) of MaPP depend on the type of shock and friction 
that want to be mitigaged. 

To support this idea empirically, notice that the data (Cerutti, Claessens, et al (2017, JFS)) suggest that more MaPP tools have been used over time.

## [4] Complementarity between MaPP and Sterilized Interventions in EMEs 

The currency risk and the fragility to external shocks consitutes a primary concern in EMEs. That explains why the financial institutions targeted tools that aim to limit the volume of lending in foreign currency are more prevalent than borrower based tools in these economies. Unsurprisingly, the Central Banks in these economies have intervened actively in foreign currency markets and consequently have increased substantially their holdings of foreign denoninated assets. Still if sterilized, these interventions can be costly imply a policy tradeoff. Thus, it is interesting to determine whether MaPP can be used as a substitute of these interventions in a similar spirit as Fujiwara, Davis, and Wang (2021) show for capital controls. It would be also interesting to study whether it matters for these policies to be applied in isolation or in tandem.
<!--- Possible frameworks: SOE, or LOE with Center and Periphery. This work is highly motivated by the fact that EMEs care more about currency fluctuations when setting their macroprudential policies. That is one of the main features that distinguish them from AEs. -->

## [5] The Welfare Cost Of Shadowbanking in Emerging Economies

The main macroprudential policy challenge at the moment is the existence of shadow-banking financial intermediaries. The presence of these firms limits the scope and possibly the effectiveness of the macro-prudential tools. This paper aims to determine the degree in which the former holds true under different structures of the banking sector in an emergent economy. Furthermore, we analize which cases are more detrimental from a regulatory perspective by analyzing the welfare cost and resilience of the financial sector that is partially regulated.

**Setup:** Two representative banks in an EME. One commercial bank that intermediates deposits and is subject to a MaP tax and a friction. One shadow bank that lends to firms but is funded with foreign lending. 

Several interesting scenarios/options:

The two EME banks may or not be financially linked via domestic interbank lending. 

Foreign lending may be subject to a country premium (due to agency friction) but also to currency risk.

Limited domestic deposits, more reliance in foreign lending, but only one bank is regulated, still there are local balance sheet limks between the EME banks 


What is the welfare cost of not being capable of regulating the whole banking sector?, welfare comparison with fully regulated banks (what if we could regulate the shadow bank? the cost could be ample, or null but implying stonger policies in the regulated fraction of the financial sector)

How effective is the MaPP in scenarios with a double layer of agency frictions? (policy debate between leaning towards Universal Banking or Separation)

By how much is compromised the recovery of the economy after a financial crisis? (is the recessionary effect stronger and more persistent?)

**Hypothesis:** in a fully regulated banking sector the dependence on a financial center already creates a fragility of peripheral countries (global financial cycle). Such vulnerability may be amplified by the precense of an unregulated banking sector as it renders the MaPP unable to mitigate the effects of external shocks and the financial frictions.

<!--- for empirical exploration: current stufies limited by the fact that MaPP sre dummies. Recently iMaPP produced statistics for the level of LTV across countries, yet they studied the]at variable at the individual country level. Something unprecedented, would be to perform the cross country effects analysis with the MaPP varisble that accounts for the intensity of the policy (in addition to the usual of counting types of policies used as proxy or MaPP tightening).-->
