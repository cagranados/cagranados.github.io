## [1] limiting regulatory arbitrage with regulation:

Studies on effectiveness of MaP indicate that the effect of the tools may change greatly depending on the scope at which they are applied. For example, 
LTV limits applied only on household deposits may lead to a switch towards non-bank (shadow) financial intermediaries or foreign banks by borrowers (IMF, iMaPP paper 2019 and presentation). It may be also the case that such arbitrage could be limited if, simultaneously, other policies are active, such as strict capital requirements on other banking activities. Then it could be that the MaPP should be applied in tandem, rather than independently. It can be interesting to check to what extent: 

1) MaPP tools can be sustitute or complementary measures (does one make the other redundant, or it makes sense to apply them both to have the intended effect and limit 
arbitrage?).
2) it is more efficient, in terms of the cost of policy (implementation for example) to attack a given friction with more than one instrument. 
3) verifying if statements on complementarity, subsitutability and conveniency of extensive application (in tandem) of MaPP depend on the type of shock and friction 
that want to be mitigaged. 

To support this idea empirically, notice that the data (Cerutti, Claessens, et al (2017, JFS)) suggest that more MaPP tools have been used over time.
