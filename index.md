## Welcome
I am a Economist at the Central Bank of Colombia. I obtained a Ph.D. in Economics at the [University of Washington](https://econ.washington.edu) (UDub) in July 2021 under the supervision of Prof. [Yu-chin Chen](http://faculty.washington.edu/yuchin/wordpress/) and Prof. [Ippei Fujiwara](https://sites.google.com/site/ippeifujiwara/).

My main areas of research are <u>International Macroeconomics</u> and <u>International Finance</u>. I am also interested in applied econometrics and Macroeconomics. 

<!-- In my current research projects I study how to implement macroprudential policies in emerging economies. -->

I am on the economics job market during the 2021-22 academic year.

  I study whether emerging economies can navigate the global financial cycle more successfully by resorting to internationally coordinated macroprudential regulations. For this, I set an open economy model with banking frictions in a center-periphery environment with multiple emerging economies. Then, I evaluate the performance of several policy arrangements that differ by the degree and type of cooperation. I find that cooperation is not always beneficial relative to nationally-oriented policies. Instead, only schemes where the financial center acts cooperatively generate welfare gains. Two mechanisms generate the gains: a cancellation effect of national incentives to manipulate the global interest rate and a policy motive under cooperation (with a center) for steering larger investment flows to emerging economies. The first mechanism eliminates unnecessary movements in the policy instruments, and the second helps prevent capital retrenchments in the financial center. Finally, the short-run dynamics show these mechanisms lead to smoother and conservative policy responses that allow for a better performance of the peripheries after external shocks, while generating improved leverage dynamics that favor the global economic recovery. These results make a case for cooperation as a way to mitigate the potential adverse effects of excessive fluctuations in the macroprudential instruments. <br></p></div>

  | **Abstract**          |
  |:---------------------------|
  | <font color="black">This paper constructs a quantitative model of intergenerational mobility in which lifetime income mobility is shaped by various channels including parental time investments in children. The calibrated model delivers positive educational gradients in parental time investment, as observed in the data, and also successfully accounts for untargeted distributional aspects of income mobility, captured in the income quintile transition matrix. The model implies that removing the positive educational gradients in parental time investment during the whole childhood would reduce intergenerational income persistence nearly by 40 percent. Policy experiments suggest that subsidies to childhood investments that can diminish positive educational gradients in parental time investments would increase intergenerational mobility, and that there are better ways of subsidizing investments to achieve greater mobility in terms of aggregate output and welfare.</font> |

  <summary markdown="span"><font color="blue">Aggregate Fluctuations in a Model of Indivisible Labor Supply with Endogenous Workweek Length</font></summary>
    
  | **Abstract**          |
  |:---------------------------|
  | <font color="black">This paper studies aggregate fluctuations in a simple extension of the classical indivisible labor supply model of Rogerson (1988) and Hansen (1985). The model allows a firm to choose hours as well as employment in the presence of a nonlinear mapping from hours worked to labor services and employment adjustment costs. Households take as given state-dependent hours per worker, which are optimally chosen by the firm, and make intertemporal labor supply decisions along the extensive margin. Although the model does not explicitly allow households to choose desired hours worked, the preference parameter governing the intensive margin Frisch elasticity of households shapes aggregate labor market fluctuations along both intensive and extensive margins, in contrast to pure indivisible labor models.</font> |
