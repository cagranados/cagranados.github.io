## Welcome to my website
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the [University of Washington](https://econ.washington.edu)

My main areas of research are International Macroeconomics and International Finance. I am also very interested in applied econometrics and Macroeconomics in general. In my current research projects I study how to implement macroprudential policies in emerging economies. TBA

# Research

- Macroprudential Policy Coordination in Emerging Economies: A Multicountry Approach
- Strategic Macroprudential Policy Setting in Emerging Economics: The Role of Coordination

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jcamilogranados/jcamilogranados.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
