## Welcome to my website
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the [University of Washington](https://econ.washington.edu) (UW) where I work under the supervision of Prof. [Yu-chin Chen](http://faculty.washington.edu/yuchin/wordpress/) and Prof. [Ippei Fujiwara](https://sites.google.com/site/ippeifujiwara/).

Before UW I worked as an economist at the Central Bank of Colombia while completing post-graduate studies at the National University of Colombia.

My main areas of research are <u>International Macroeconomics</u> and <u>International Finance</u>. I am also interested in applied econometrics and Macroeconomics in general. 

In my current research projects I study how to implement macroprudential policies in emerging economies.
