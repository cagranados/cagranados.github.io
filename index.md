## Welcome to my website
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the [University of Washington](https://econ.washington.edu)

My main areas of research are International Macroeconomics and International Finance. I am also very interested in applied econometrics and Macroeconomics in general. In my current research projects I study how to implement macroprudential policies in emerging economies. TBA
