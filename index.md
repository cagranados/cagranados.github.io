## Welcome
I am a Economist at the Central Bank of Colombia. I obtained a Ph.D. in Economics at the [University of Washington](https://econ.washington.edu) (UW) in July 2021 under the supervision of Prof. [Yu-chin Chen](http://faculty.washington.edu/yuchin/wordpress/) and Prof. [Ippei Fujiwara](https://sites.google.com/site/ippeifujiwara/).

My main areas of research are <u>International Macroeconomics</u> and <u>International Finance</u>. I am also interested in applied econometrics and Macroeconomics. 

<!-- In my current research projects I study how to implement macroprudential policies in emerging economies. -->

I am on the economics job market during the 2021-22 academic year.

  I study whether emerging economies can navigate the global financial cycle more successfully by resorting to internationally coordinated macroprudential regulations. For this, I set an open economy model with banking frictions in a center-periphery environment with multiple emerging economies. Then, I evaluate the performance of several policy arrangements that differ by the degree and type of cooperation. I find that cooperation is not always beneficial relative to nationally-oriented policies. Instead, only schemes where the financial center acts cooperatively generate welfare gains. Two mechanisms generate the gains: a cancellation effect of national incentives to manipulate the global interest rate and a policy motive under cooperation (with a center) for steering larger investment flows to emerging economies. The first mechanism eliminates unnecessary movements in the policy instruments, and the second helps prevent capital retrenchments in the financial center. Finally, the short-run dynamics show these mechanisms lead to smoother and conservative policy responses that allow for a better performance of the peripheries after external shocks, while generating improved leverage dynamics that favor the global economic recovery. These results make a case for cooperation as a way to mitigate the potential adverse effects of excessive fluctuations in the macroprudential instruments. <br></p></div></details>

  | **Abstract**          |
  |:---------------------------|
  | <font color="black">East Asians, especially South Koreans, appear to be preoccupied with their offspring's education---most children spend time in expensive private institutes and in cram schools in the evenings and on weekends. At the same time, South Korea currently has the lowest total fertility rate in the world. In this paper, we propose a theory with status externalities and endogenous fertility that connects these two facts. Using a quantitative heterogeneous-agent model  calibrated to Korea, we find that fertility would be 16% higher in the absence of the status externality and that childlessness in the poorest quintile would fall from five to less than one percent. We further show that the externality amplifies the fertility decline over time. We then explore the effects of various government policies. A pro-natal transfer increases fertility and reduces education while an education tax reduces both education and fertility, with heterogeneous effects across the income distribution.  The policy mix that maximizes the current generation's welfare consists of an education tax of 12% and moderate pro-natal transfers---a monthly child allowance of 3% of average income for 18 years. This would raise average fertility by about 5% and decrease education spending by 16\%.  Although this policy increases the welfare of the current generation, it may not do the same for future generations as it lowers their human capital. </font> |
