## Welcome
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the [University of Washington](https://econ.washington.edu) (UW) where I work under the supervision of Prof. [Yu-chin Chen](http://faculty.washington.edu/yuchin/wordpress/) and Prof. [Ippei Fujiwara](https://sites.google.com/site/ippeifujiwara/).

Before UW I worked as an economist at the Central Bank of Colombia while completing post-graduate studies at the National University of Colombia.

My main areas of research are <u>International Macroeconomics</u> and <u>International Finance</u>. I am also interested in applied econometrics and Macroeconomics in general. 

In my current research projects I study how to implement macroprudential policies in emerging economies. 

I am on the economics job market during the 2020-21 academic year.

## Research 

- Strategic Macroprudential Policymaking: When Does Cooperation Pay Off? \[[pdf](/files/papers/MaPDynamic.pdf)\] \[[slides](/files/papers/MaPdynSlides_BbagUW11272020.pdf)\]  **(Job Market Paper)**

      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>  The US Interstate Highway System had a significant impact on market accessibility and transportation costs between regions. Whether this should lead to increased clustering of economic activity due to increased ‘economic centripetal forces’ or a dispersal from ‘centrifugal forces’ depends on factors that differ by industry. This paper suggests the impact depends on truck transportation utilization and input-output linkages. Utilizing travel time data constructed using GIS techniques along with BEA data on the spatial distribution of economic activity, a simple panel estimation is conducted to test the theory. </p></div>
